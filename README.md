Object-Oriented Programming in Python 🐍

This project is a collection of Python programs demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts with practical examples.
It is designed for students, beginners, and anyone who wants to understand how OOP principles work in Python.

📚 Concepts Covered

Classes & Objects – Creating and using objects.

Encapsulation – Public, Protected, and Private members (e.g., BankAccount).

Abstraction – Using abstract base classes (PaymentProcessor, Shape).

Inheritance – Parent and child class relationships (Animal, Dog, Cat).

Polymorphism – Same interface with different implementations (Shape, Duck/Robot/Dog examples).

Constructors & Static Methods – Demonstrating special methods and utility functions.

🛠️ Project Structure

The repository includes different Python scripts with examples:

Bank Account Example → Demonstrates encapsulation with private, protected, and public attributes.

Duck, Robot, Dog → Shows polymorphism by sharing the same interface (make_sound, swim).

Payment Processor → Abstract base class with multiple concrete implementations (Credit Card, PayPal, Bank Transfer).

Shapes (Rectangle, Circle, Triangle) → Demonstrates abstraction and polymorphism via area & perimeter calculations.

Student Class → Shows constructors, attributes, and methods in action.

Car Class → Example with static methods, private methods, and constructor overloading.

Animal Inheritance → Demonstrates parent-child relationships and method overriding.

🚀 How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/IqraEjaz12/object-oriented-programming.git


Navigate into the project folder:

cd object-oriented-programming


Run the Python file:

python filename.py


Replace filename.py with the script you want to run (e.g., bank_account.py, shapes.py).

💡 Example Output

For example, running the Shapes program will print:

Shape: Rectangle
Area: 20
Perimeter: 18
Shape: Triangle
Area: 17.5
Perimeter: 18
Shape: Circle
Area: 113.04
Perimeter: 37.68

🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

Practice OOP concepts in Python.

Provide easy-to-understand code examples for students.

Serve as a reference project for resumes or learning portfolios.

📌 Requirements

Python 3.x
